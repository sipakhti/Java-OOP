CLASSES
    these are blueprints which can be used to instantiate new instances of objects. Unlike objects, Classes are not stored on the heap

OBJECTS
    these are the instances created in the memory using a Class as a template.

ENCAPSULATION
    It is the first concept of OOP. It states that the data as well as the methods that act on that data must be bundled together in a single unit(CLASS)

ABSTRACTION
    It is the second concept of OOP. It is built on the premise that unnecessary information looks ugly.
    Fields should be private and only accessible via getters and setter only if absolutely necessary otherwise even those methods should be hidden.
    Only those methods which are used as an interface should be made public so as to not overwhelm the end user but also to decrease coupling
    Under the hood methods must always be hidden away from plain sight.

COUPLING
    it means inter dependency of Classes. It cannot be completely avoided as at least one point of coupling will always be present but nonetheless, it should be minimized.
    Over dependency causes a chain reaction if a single class is modified, necessitating updating of coupled classes and if not then at least re-compiling of those classes is must
    Abstraction is a very good practice to follow to minimize un necessary coupling.
